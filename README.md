Hi 
I'm **Faeze Ahmadi**, a Master's student in **Computer Engineering – Artificial Intelligence and Robotics** at the **Institute for Advanced Studies in Basic Sciences (IASBS), Zanjan, Iran**.

I was directly admitted to the M.Sc. program through the **Exceptional Talent (Gifted Student)** program, continuing my studies at IASBS from my undergraduate degree.

In this repository, I share my **university projects, reports, and research works** related to **Artificial Intelligence and Robotics**.  
I’m passionate about learning, experimenting, and continuously improving my understanding of intelligent systems.
